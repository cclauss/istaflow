#istaflow
Istaflow is automation app built for pythonista. This has been inspired by workflow for iOS you can find it here [Workflow](https://workflow.is)

You create flows to run flows. Each flow is made up of a series of elements. These elements have a single purpose and are reusable across flows.

Istaflow currently can run basic flows currently with simple validation for an input to each element.
Istaflow it is in active development but should still be classed as beta as there will be plenty of bugs and features still to add. 

This has been built with pythonista 1.6 beta/2.0 and has only had slight testing in 1.5. 
NOTE: Now that 2.0 has been released I wont be supporting 1.5 so all work arounds that have been included will eventually be removed.
